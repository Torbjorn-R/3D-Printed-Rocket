# 🚀 3D-Printed Rocket Project

This is was my final in-depth project for physics 1 class, where I designed, 3D printed, and launched a functional rocket. The repository includes STL files, build photos, instructions (if you want to build your own) and a video of the launch.

## 📂 Contents

- STL files for all rocket parts
- Build and launch photos
- Launch video
- Short explanation of the process
